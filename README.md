# Classification of Wine Types using the Logistic Regression
 This project helps us to classify the type of wine based upon the features such as color intensity, presence of magnesium, phenols,etc.

## Dataset
 This project utilises the standard `load_wine` dataset to classify the target into **3 classes** - *class_0,class_1 and class_2* based upon it's features. This projects demonstrates the use of **logistic regression** to *classifiy* the *dataset*.We create a *dataframe* using `panda library` to create the **features matrix ( X )** and **target vector ( y )**.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. We have plotted a histogram of all the wine features which highlights about the characteristics of each feature!
2.
